I'm a multi purpose code juggler and also big fan of Svelte. I like a lot of code languages but my favorite one is teh one people also mess up a lot. :)
Got more projects in private than i can count, and a lot of done diddle do Projects for clients.

I love nerdy stuff, going out making party, hanging out with cool people and develop what i like to use for myself and nobody wants to develop (especially handy scripts so i dont need to redo the pain of setup ☝️).

(I also love Server Hosting/DevOps/.., VPN, Mail, Webserver, implementing on basis of RFCs :3 & a lot of other stuff)
